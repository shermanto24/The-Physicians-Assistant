# The Physician's Assistant

My final project for AP Computer Science A, made in 2020.

## Description 

The Physician's Assistant is a game with two modes: regular and story mode. In regular mode, the player is free to try any stage they want, but the story parts associated with each are not shown. In story mode ("Full Day"), the player goes through all the stages in order and completes a story. The end of the story depends on the choices they make during the story sections.

In any stage, the objective is to collect a certain number of life orbs, which are represented by yellow circles that spawn uniformly. The required number of orbs to collect is 25 for the easy ("Morning") and hard ("Evening") stages, and 50 for the normal ("Afternoon") stage. The player's progress in collecting the orbs is shown at the top right of the screen. The speed at which the orbs and obstacles appear on the screen increases with the difficulty.

Obstacles, which appear as red squares or rectangles, spawn randomly in each stage. The squares spawn on the ground, so the player must jump over them. On the other hand, the rectangles spawn in midair, so the player must crouch to avoid them. Whenever the player collides with an obstacle, they lose one life ("health potion") out of the three provided to them in each stage. If the player uses up all three lives, they fail the stage and are brought back to the main menu.

The player only really wins or loses if they play story mode. They win if they make certain choices in the story and pass all the stages, and they lose if they fail any of the stages. In either mode, the player returns to the menu if they fail a stage, so they can replay as many times as they want.

## How to Play

The player uses the mouse to navigate the main menu. From there, they can choose to open the tutorial, play individual stages (regular mode), or play the story mode, which goes through all three stages.

In each stage, the player uses the space bar to jump and the C key to crouch. In story mode, the player can use either the mouse of the enter key to go through the story boxes.
